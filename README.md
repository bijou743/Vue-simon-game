# Simon The Game

This project based on a Test task Junior FrontDev.

The task is to create Simon The Game. The rules of the game are:

- The game board consists of 4 squares/buttons - each of them contains one of 4 colors and lights up on click.
- The round of the game consists of two phases. In the first phase application shows to the user some sequence by highlighting buttons randomly. In the second phase user has to reproduce the sequence by clicking the buttons.
- If the user makes a mistake in the sequence than the game is over and application shows this information to the user.
- Every next round of the game has more steps in the sequence.
